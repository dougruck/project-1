# project-1
Hi.  I originally submitted a .zip file or proj 1 before I found the developers environment at the end of the project.  So... I 
played with it on the developers environment and, after some tweaking, got it down to about 6% and submitted it.  But, 
unfortunately, the original .zip submission eventually got evaluated and came up lacking.  So, I just submitted the updated
files here on github.  Hopefully y'all don't have to look at it for a third time.  
Thanks,
-Doug
